# Introduce yourself (80-120 words)
summary: I am an Ontario Tech University alumnus with a B.Eng. (Honours) in Software Engineering. During my studies, I gained hands-on experience as a Software Engineer Intern at Bell Mobility, where I led optimization projects and implemented automation solutions to enhance system efficiency using Alteryx and cloud computing, collaborating with the IT team to schedule tasks. I worked closely with cross-functional teams, including data science, software development, and machine learning experts, to develop machine learning models that significantly improved customer acquisition strategies. My expertise spans cloud computing, data management, and AI-driven analytics, and I am passionate about driving innovation in large-scale automation and predictive technologies. In my free time, I enjoy playing chess and staying active.

# List of Jarvis projects
jarvis_projects:
  - name: "Linux Cluster Resource Monitoring App"
    git_url: "/linux_sql"
    description: Developed a solution to monitor cluster nodes by using Bash scripts to collect hardware specifications and real-time resource usage data (CPU, memory, disk). The data was stored in a PostgreSQL database running in a Docker container. To ensure continuous data collection, the host usage script was automated using cron, executing every minute. This application is useful for system administrators to track and manage system performance across multiple nodes, enabling proactive maintenance and resource optimization by providing insights into hardware usage data to prevent potential bottlenecks.

# List of personal or academic projects
highlighted_projects:
  - name: "Adaptive Cruise Control"
    git_url: ""
    description: Developed software for autonomous vehicles to utilize LiDAR and depth camera sensors for mimicking adaptive cruise control functionality, including vehicle platooning (grouping) to optimize lane usage on highways and other real-road scenarios. Sensor data was processed through a computer vision model to estimate distance and classify obstacles, which was then fed into a neural network model for optimizing decision-making. The system was built on ROS2 and Autoware, leveraging a publish-subscribe (pub-sub) algorithm for inter-node communication within the simulation environment.
  - name: "P2P Social"
    git_url: ""
    description: A decentralized social network distributed across multiple devices using blockchain technology, ensuring content is secure, immutable, and free from centralized control. Networking within P2P Social is handled using Java NIO TCP connections. Upon starting the daemon, each node is assigned a listening socket for managing incoming connections, which allows other nodes to send updates regarding new nodes, blockchain changes, and more. The network leverages asymmetric encryption to validate post integrity and offers true end-to-end encrypted private messaging. It also ensures network availability even if individual nodes fail. Administrators can extend the platform with new features as blockchain-based blocks, allowing seamless software updates without the need to create separate networks. Additionally, the design decouples the network from user interfaces, enabling custom interfaces on mobile, desktop, or command line platforms.
