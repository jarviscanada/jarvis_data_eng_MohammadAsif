# Mohammad Hamza Asif . Jarvis Consulting

I am an Ontario Tech University alumnus with a B.Eng. (Honours) in Software Engineering. During my studies, I gained hands-on experience as a Software Engineer Intern at Bell Mobility, where I led optimization projects and implemented automation solutions to enhance system efficiency using Alteryx and cloud computing, collaborating with the IT team to schedule tasks. I worked closely with cross-functional teams, including data science, software development, and machine learning experts, to develop machine learning models that significantly improved customer acquisition strategies. My expertise spans cloud computing, data management, and AI-driven analytics, and I am passionate about driving innovation in large-scale automation and predictive technologies. In my free time, I enjoy playing chess and staying active.

**Linux Cluster Resource Monitoring App** [[GitHub](https://github.com/jarviscanada/jarvis_data_eng_MohammadAsif/tree/master/linux_sql)]: Developed a solution to monitor cluster nodes by using a Bash script to collect hardware specifications and real-time resource usage data (CPU, memory, disk). The data was stored in a PostgreSQL database running in a Docker container. To ensure continuous data collection, the host usage script was automated using cron, executing every minute. This application is useful for system administrators to track and manage system performance across multiple nodes, enabling proactive maintenance and resource optimization by providing insights into hardware usage data to prevent potential bottlenecks.


## Highlighted Projects
**Adaptive Cruise Control**: Developed software to utilize LiDAR and depth camera sensors for mimicking adaptive cruise control functionality, including vehicle platooning (grouping) to optimize lane usage on highways and other real-road scenarios. Sensor data was processed through a computer vision model to estimate distance and classify obstacles, which was then fed into a neural network model for optimizing decision-making. The system was built on ROS2 and Autoware, leveraging a publish-subscribe (pub-sub) algorithm for inter-node communication within the simulation environment.

**P2P Social**: A decentralized social network distributed across multiple devices using blockchain technology. This ensures content is secure, immutable, and free from centralized control. The network leverages asymmetric encryption to validate post integrity, offers true end-to-end encrypted private messaging, and ensures network availability even if individual nodes fail. Administrators can extend the platform with new features as blockchain-based blocks, allowing seamless software updates without creating separate networks. The design also decouples the network from user interfaces, enabling custom interfaces on mobile, desktop, or command line platforms.


## Professional Experiences

**Junior Software Engineer, Jarvis (Sep 2024  Present)**: With the software consulting team at Jarvis, I am responsible for utilizing technologies like GCP, Git, Linux, Bash, and Docker to optimize and automate processes. I assist in developing and maintaining cloud-based infrastructure, ensuring efficient deployment pipelines, and supporting continuous integration and delivery (CI/CD) workflows.

**Software Engineer Intern, Bell Mobility (May 2022  Aug 2023)**: I led the research and development of optimization strategies for propagation models, significantly improving mobility prediction accuracy through analytical techniques and effective cross-functional collaboration. I developed and implemented automation tools using Alteryx, cloud computing, and Python, streamlining operations and ensuring high data integrity, which enhanced wireless network predictions. Additionally, I co-developed a machine learning model for optimizing customer acquisition strategies with predictive analytics. I also worked on various development projects, utilizing Python and C#, and collaborated closely with IT to develop and maintain automation scripts that improved overall operational efficiency.
